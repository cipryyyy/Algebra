# Algebra Assistant Calculator

## What can it do?

Basic calculator to help with algebra operations such as:
* Multiplication of Matrixes and Scalar/Matrix
* Addition and subtractions of Matrixes
* Determinants, Transpositions and Inversions of Matrixes

Currently you must write everything manually inside of the main.cpp file, but a parser will be added shortly.

## How to use it
**CMAKE IS REQUIRED**

1. **Clone** or **download** the repo
2. Create a build directory (for the binary) wherever you  want
3. Run CMake
4. Write where is the source code inside of the first form and where is the build folder inside of the second one.
5. Hit *Configure* and *Generate*
6. Open the terminal and navigate to the *build* folder
7. Write `make`, this will create a file named `calc`

### To-do list
The calculator is kinda basic and it is only a terminal application, the GUI will be implemented when the calculator will be more complete.

A lot of operations (e.g rank of matrixes, eugenvalues, eugenvectors...) and concepts (Spaces and vectors) are missing.

It's just a funny project that I'm creating while I study for the Algebra exam.
